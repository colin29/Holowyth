Lecia: *Haa!!*

todo: {3x slash}


 

Elvin: Ghh!

Elvin: (There's an opening when she strikes sideways, her grip finishes weak, if I can counter then!)

todo: {Slash sound}

Elvin: (Ah...)

Lecia: Haaa!

Elvin: ...I yield.

Lecia: ...It's my win again! Yippee!  

Elvin: What is it now, 7-2 this month?

Lecia: Are you sure you haven't been slacking off? You don't attack back at all.

Elvin: Give me a break... Do you hard it is to look for an opening while defending?

Lecia: Well defending's not really my style... Just get them before they get you!

Elvin: That doesn't work if you're faster than me. Not everyone has talent like you, Lecia.

Lecia: You just need to practice and find what you're good at.

Elvin: I guess... Oh, it's Master.
