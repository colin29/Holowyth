# Holowyth
A 2D real-time tactics RPG

.

Set up instructions:
1. Clone repo:
2. Run gradlew on Holowyth and ProjectVisualNovel root directory  (ProjectVisualNovel is located in lib/ProjectVisualNovel. Gradle version is 6.3)
3. Import Holowyth to Eclipse (or other IDE)
4. Import ProjectVisualNovel to Eclipse
5. Add ProjectVisualNovel-core to Holowyth-core and Holowyth-desktop's classpath in Eclipse

ProjectVisualNovel is a special library in that its not referenced on the  gradle build file. So it needs to be setup and added manually
